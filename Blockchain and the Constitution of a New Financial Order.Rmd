# Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- *Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems*
## Challenges
+ General Challenges
+ Legal and regulatory challenges
+ Technical Challenges
+ Business challenges
There is overlap between each of these areas

## Multidimensional Challenges
Underdeveloped ecosystem
- Adoption of a blockchain is necessary but not enough
- need a whole ecosystem of stakeholders focused around the adoption of such a technology
- Complete Tech stacks.
- analysts
- users
  
## Multidimensional Challenges
Lack of educated individuals
- Niche area, means very limited amount software developers
- Mid 2016 there were appox. 5000 developers
- Compare the number to Java at approx 18.5 million developers
- Lack of educated individuals at an executive level.


## Multidimensional Challenges
Lack of Standards
+ Standards arrive as 
    - De-facto virtue of market adoption
    - Via organisations puting standards into place
+ Standards will introduce many aspects
    - Increased adoption
    - Interoperability
    - Lower costs and less overall risks
+ Standards also help with other topics
    - Use cases
    - Terminology, taxonomy, ontology and reference architecture.
            

## Multidimensional Challenges            
Blockchain is a foundational technology 
- it will take a long time for wide spread adoption
- Relies on a 'kiler app' and such like development to really push the technology
    

## Legal and Regulatory Challenges
Uncertain regulatory status

- Paradigm shifts

- Regulation, yes -- better later than never

What can be done to reduce regulatory unsertainty?

- The uncertainty is normal, its a new technology.
    
## Legal and Regulatory Challenges
Political/governmental intervention
- Political vision of the current 4IR (what is 4IR???)

- Internet of value -- dont want to reduce the value that such technology can have

- Consumer Protection

- Lacking a clear understanding that this is the next industrial revolution.

- Many new challenges from a consumer perspective.

# Tomaso Aste (UCL): What is truth? Blockchain Technology and history by majority consensus

## The Trust Machine
True to some extent
- Verified by large communities
- Hard to tamper with purely cause of size and decentralised nature
- Verified recorded immutable history of fair-play, gives reputation to involved agents.
  
No need for trusted intermediaries

## Blochchain
 - Google 'structre of blockchain', cba to type it out.
 
## origins of blockchain
- Started with Hash trees (merkle trees) and hash chains
- Got to electronic hash chain payments in the 90s
- Proof of work via Hash Cash
- Bitcoin came around after (2008)


## Distribution + Community Consensus = Trues
- Consensus => transparency
- Consensus => Truth decided by community majority
- Consensus => History is probabilistic

# All Truth within the system is by consensus
- Not necessarily the Truth, just the aggreed one.
- The consensus can very well be wrong.
- Generating Hashes doesn't necessarily validate truth.
    - Just that is accepted as having happend
    - Then its completely immutable
    - For storing information, this means that lies can be immutably stored.
    
## Consensus comes with a cost
- There a lot of insentive to alter the truth
- It costs the community a lot of computing power to ensure validity is maintained
- (note: this only applies to proof of work, proof of stake would make it a monetary issue)


## Challenges
- Efficiency and scalability
- Legal implications for code misbehaviour
    - Some code may even be automatically generated wihin a distributed and unsupervised system
    - Who is responsible
    - Who will regulate/supervise

## Challenges
- Can we afford to keep immutable historic records
    - Probably not
    - What if there is a war
    - What if there are criminal organisations?

- Can blockchains be made future proof
    - Preserve integrity
    - In the future current cryptographic technology will likely be broken
    
    
# Ioannis Lianos (UCL) -- Law, Fintech and the perfomative turn in regulation

## Drastic and Disruptive innovation
- bitcoin -- one of the first successful applicaitons of a distrubuted ledger 
- bitcoin 2.0 -- to store all kinds of information
- ethereum -- software platform for the development and deployment of all kinds of decentalised applications

## blockchain and fintech
5 principals underlying the technology
- Distributed database
- P2P transmission
- Transparency with pseudonymity
- Immutability of records
- Comutational logic
    
- Fintech is the amalgomation of finance and technology.

## Regulators -- promoting competition and innovation
- Financial conduct authority - promote effective competition in the interest of consumers
- Payment systems regulator - specific interests relating to the payment sector. promote insterests of users and services provided by payment systems.

## Regulatory Initiatives
- FCA -- project Innovate
- Regulatory Sandbox -- A sandbox from which businesses have a 'safe space' to experiement with new technology.
    - This can be used to introduce unauthorised businesses to the market
    - Allows regulatory authorities to test the impact of new regulations.
- Regulation becomes a collaboration industry
    - Bespoke regulatory rules
  
## Payment system regulators
- Heavily interested in blockchain technology
- Bank of England -- regulatory investigations
    - Research Hub
    - FinTech Accelerator
- Prudential Regulatoryt Authority


## Rules vs prinicals base
- Principals based regulation promotes collaboration
    - Authorities state what they want to achieve
    - Leads to Algorithmic Regulation
    - Lean regulation
    - Agile regulation
    
    
## Platforms vs Blockchain
- Blockchain aren't platforms
- OpenBazaar, Amazon, Google
- Competition between existing platforms to produce their own system.

## OpenBazaar and markets
Will it lead to a wide open competative market?

- Still an issue with centralised groups of hashing teams
- These groups will be competative
    - still not down to the individuals

## Lack of quantitiative measurements for innovation
- As regulatory authories lack methods of quantifying the promotion of innovaiton
    - regarding its success at least
    
- performative regulation will take be more prominent
    - this measn more interaction and involvment between regulators and businesses.


#Karen Yeung -  *Governence by blockchain: the coming battle for supremacy between code of law vs code as law.*
## Introduction

- Explore the intersection and interactions of conventional law and internal rules of blockchain systems

- How success will 'governance by blockchain' be at avoding governance by conventional law?

- Algorithmic Governence
    - predictive analytics and automated decision making systems
    - distributed ledger systems.

- Focus on developed markets, undevelopeed markets might not even have a government capable of rivaling 'Cryptolaw'.


## Emergence of CryptoLaw
- Ethereum -- a Cryptolaw system (ie blockchain code as law)
    - a set of rules administered through the use of smart contracts
    
    
## Blockchain as beyond the reach of law
- Radical libertarian ideological rhetoric associated with Blockchain technology
    - Premise of which is the assumption that the distrubted and decentralised network renders it unregulatable
    
- Similar claims were made regarding the internet. this proved to be a falacy

- As blockchain applications emerge they will become more detatched from the ideological side of blockchain.

## Types of interaction between blockchain code and law
- Hostile Evation -- use of blockchain to evade the limits of the law
- supportive alignment -- use of blockchain to compliment and suppliment conventional law
- Uneasy co-existence -- use of blockchain to avoid the inconvenience and Mutual suspicion.


## Hostile evation
- Use of blockchain tech and decentralised tech to avoid the law.
    - Cyber crime, extortion, tax avoidance
- Legal systems have asserted sovereign authority of law over thse activities.

- Virtual currencies should comply with existing money laundering regulations
- Bitcoin exchanges are treated as regulated intermediaries

## Practical battle for supremacy
- Considerable challenges in applying conventional law enforcment methods against perpetrators

- Conventional law may assert authority over code
    - Can it actually exercise that authority though?
    
- This creates a practical battle between the law and blockchain tech

- Regulatory targets:
    - wallet providers/exchanges
    - And others.
    
## supportive alignment
- Instead of using blockchains to avoid the law -- use to compliment the law.

- Can be used to streamline and enhance the efficiency of compliance.

- Can provide realtime information on thew state of transacitons between users.

- R3's Corda - distributed ledger designed by and for the regulatory industry.

- Not a formal 'battle for supremacy' because they are designed to work together

## uneasy co-existence
- Use vlockchain to avoid the procedural burdens and transaction costs associated with conventional law

- Not trying to subvert the law
    - Just not wanting to bother with the hassel of the clunky and slow system of law that exists.
    
- DAO was an example of this.
    - Developed with the intention of engaging in venture style investements
    - Gives the everyday consumer the opportunity to invest in exciting projects and startups
    
    
## Uneasy co-existence
- Imagnne no hardfork happend after the DAO exploit
    - would the conventional law reached into the transaction? 
- Would a court have refused to take part?

## Uneasy co-existence
- Are blockchain technologies a legitimate or illegitimate attempt to oust conventional law?
- DAOs exist in a regulatory greyzone
    - may not offer liability, protection or accountability guarantees.




# Giovanni Sartor -- Semantics and Pragmatics of self enforcing laws and contracts
## Contracts, logic based smart contracts and blockchain systems
- A project to find a new way to write smart contracts
    - An alternative to Ethereums smart contract system
    
- Aim to reduce the differnece between a smart contract language (like solidity) and human language
    - Increased accessability
- Imperative languages normally used to create smart contracts
- The aim is to move to a more declarative style


## what is a smart contract?
- A program that is used to express an agreement between users
- A program that enacts some kind of transaction or action.

- These contracts can automatically enforce the agreements made.


## What are the problems with these contracts and all contracts?
- Can be very difficult to understand unless familiar with the technology
- Often 'seasoned' with additional formalities.
- This is a problem when trying to expand the reaches of the technology to the general public
    - Trusting of smart contracts will be difficult if there is no understanding.
    
## Defeasable Logic
- A logic represnetation of smart contracts

## Advantages of a declarative language
- Accessability for lawyers and non-technical individuals
- Means that legal authoroties that would normally draft contracts can ensure no illicit activities are being performed.
- The issue of cancelling smart contracts when legally required (like other contracts) still exists.

## Conclusion
- Smart contracts are good
- Need to ensure they are legally compliant.
- Adopt a declaritive language for clarity between stakeholders.






# Panel 2 -- *Blockchain and the future of money*

# Stefan Eich -- *The politics of Cryptocurrencies in historical perspectives*

## Crypto Currencies
- Driven by technology
- Lacking governence
- Cut off from the past (and)

## Is that the right framing?

## Argument
- The forget political disputes over money in the 70s
    - Actively written out of memory by great moderation
    - But resurfaced again with the financial crisis
- In this light cryptocurrences asa political attemt to depoliticise money.

## Hayek, the denationalisation of money (1976)

- Ending of government monopoly of the issue of money
- Decentralisation

## Gunnar Myrdal Oct 1974
- Demands for global democratic reforms
- Proposed 'welfare state' becomes a 'welfare world'
    - Via reformation of monetary systems on a global scale
    
    
## Politics of Disinflation
- After inflation hikes in the 70's/80's
- New polics of disinflation and monetary depoliticization emerged

## The great Moderation 
- Revealed that notion of money existing aside from politics was an illusion

## Financial Crisis
- The emergence of bitcoin after the financial crisis was not a coincidence
- The technology had existed for years
- 6 weeks after the collapse of 'lehsman brothers' (corect spelling) bitcoin emerged

## Bitcoin as an experiemnt of artificial scarcity
- The finite amount of bitcoin
- As more bitcoins became owned, they became more valuble

## Re-politicization
- Just as monetary systems have given rise to calls for decentralised monetary systems
- It has also created a call for more politicised systems.

## In Summary
- Cryptocurrency is intself a political act
    - A political act of depoliticisation
    
- Technology itself is politically neutral
    - Blockchains are politically agnostic, even if its applications aren't 
  
- The creators of a cryptocurrency is infact an act of lawmaking
    - Centralised around their personal political motivations and ideologies.

# Rosa Maria Lastra -- *Pubic Money vs Private Money*

## Fiat Money
- Funcitons of money
    - medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account.
- Governence
    - central bank issue, legal tender, legal counterparty
- Risks
    - theft, fraud, counter-party, inflation
- Consumer appeal
    - good store of value, realtime, reversible
- Foreign exchange
    - costly time
- Centralised clearing
    - paypal, apple pay, cheques
    
## Bitcoin (didnt want to talk about ethereum as well)
- Functions of money
    - medium of exchange, volitile store of value, negligible unit of account
- Governance
    - bitcoin protocol, issuing mining rewards
- Risks
    - medium, interface, malfunction, password (key) loss


## Monetary Sovereignty
- Traditionally
    - The power to issue and distrubute money
    - Monopoly power enjoyed by the state
- New technology
    - Digital currencies, digital payment methods
    - Signify the changing state of monetary sovereignty
  

## theories of money
- The state theory of money is different to the society theory of money are contrasting
    - A state's theory of money is that they decide what constitutes of money
    - The sociatal theory is that money is determined by what has value.
    
## Public money
- Public money is fiat money backed by the state

- Central banks issue all notes in circulation
- Fiat money, inconvertable into gold or other precious materials.
    - The government declares the paper money to be legal tender for the settlement of debts
    
## Private money
- Societal money backed by societal accpetance.
    - Enhanced by reputation/credibility.
    - Currency does not need to be legal tender to exist.
    
## Boom and Busts
- Displacement brings opportunity for profit
    - Herd behavioutr from investor euphoria
- As investors decide to cash out, others follow this movement
    - Causes busts as extensive as the booms.

## Private money and central banking.
- Crypto currencies challenge the status quo of bank monopoly
- Curencies npt backed by any central authority 
    -have a value completely dependant on peoples confidence to use it.


# Claus D. Zimmermann -- *monetary policy in the digital age*
## work in progress, not for citation -- No slides available
## sporadic points
- Interest rates
    - Quantitative easing
- Monetary stability
    - Defined as the stability of domestic prices (different to price stability?).
    
- Cryptograpgic and decentralised currencies have the potential to upheave central banks
    - thus any form of monetary policies.

## Sporadic points
- The IMF defines a series of rules that are used to evaluate the stability of monetary systems and the risks that come with them

- The IMF states that cryptocurrecies will have some of the same risks as the gold Standard

- The drawback of limited amounts of currency in a cryptocurrency doesn't necessarly need to remain so
    - Allowing for the expansion the monetary supply (the issuance of more) would requrie heavy global regulation.
    
## Sporadic points
- IMF warns that wide spread adoption of crypto currencies could see rise to a form of 'great depression' as a result of its limited supply.

- IMF states that it is dificult to see how cryptocurrencies can replace many of the emergency/last resort support functions that centralised banks have.

# Hermann Elender -- *Cryptocurrecny evolution and resiliency of blockchain markets*

## Crypto-Currencies are....
- Neither Crypto, or currency
    - Evil (krugman, 2013)
    - Not evil, too volitile (yermak 2015)
    - insignificant?
    
## Crypto vs corp market cap
- Second larges US enterprise (GOOGL) approx. 588bn
- Ethereum market cap is approx 4.5bn.

- How can these currecies be utilised if they're not worth enought to buy everything?

## Market caps
- Market cap of a traded firm reflects future value
- Crypto currencies reflect the value of the past.

What about other currencies?
- Singapore's currency was less valuble than Ethereum's
- Does that mean singapore does not have a currency?

## Crypto-Currencies are....
- Neither Crypto, or currency
    - Evil (krugman, 2013)
    - Not evil, too volitile (yermak 2015)
    - insignificant?
    
- Money?
    - unit of account??? - other cypto currencis are traded against BTC and ETH. so yes?
    - media of exchange -- sure
    - store of value -- ??? volitle...
        
- Assets
    - market micro structure and economic efficieny.

## Why are Crpyto currencies important?

- The effect that they have in all markets.
- Financial portfolios benefit greatly
- Academic research generated as a side effect.

## Crypto currencies are volatile
- Shown a std-dev graph of other currencies.
- 10% deviation +/- on a day to day basis for Eth (for example)


## Liquidity and resiliency
- How much price impact does trading have on cryptocurrencies?
    - Evolution over time
    - Resiliency to large shocks
    
- The ability to trade at fundamental value is key for economic efficiency

- In the stock market, frequently, liquidty evaporates when shocks hit.
    - How does this look in this drastically different market of cryptocurrencies?
    
## Liquidity measures

- Standard measure -- Amihud measure
    - The sum of returns over the total trading volume over a period.

- Liquid market, large orders are gonna affect pricing
- Not so liquid, large scale will have less effect on prices.

## Crypto vs stocks
- Crypto currencies are orders of magnitude away from standard stocks in liquidity
- DOW market liqudities measure along 0<liquidity<1
- Bitcoin was in the 100s a few years ago, now in 1<liqudity<10 range.

## accounting for regularities
- The time of day, year, month, holidays have regular affects of liquidity
- Need to account for these when getting a true pure liqudity reflection.

## Liquidity shocks
- Bitcoins show almost no relation between the returns and liquidity.
- Even for positive or negative returns. and large shocks.

## Conclusion
- Cryptocurrenceis are a noteworthy asset
- Very fragemented but very integreated
- Liquidity provides a better measure of the matureity than returns or market cap.


# Philipp Hacker - *Corporate Governance for complex cryptocurrencies - regulating blockchain under uncertainty*

## Governance schemes
- Two levels
    - Exact definitions of rules of the game (applying protocol)
    - Lack of rules for changing the rules of the game (updating protocol)
    
## Hard Forks
- Bitcoin hardfork
    - Core dev and miningpool suport older, shorter chain
- Ethereum Hardfork
    - DAO Hack -- essentially fork rewrote the history of the blockchain.
- Bitcoin blocksize debate
    - Discussions between developers, miners, over censorship of the chain
    
    
## Consequences.
- Vulnerability to coalitions of the willing
    - Combine powers, technological, resources and informal leadership
    
- There was anotherone... missed it...


## Complexity theory.
- Simple Order << -- >> Complexity << -- >> Chaos Theory
- Has applicatinos in the financial industry (and crypto currencies.)

## Crypto as complex system
- Dynamic interaction between independent actors over time
    - Self organised and ecentralied feedback driven processes
- Variance within groups
    - Heterogeneity among members of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
    
- Non-linearity -- elements of order, but unpredictable overtime
    - Lack of governance schemes: fluidity and unpredictability.
    
## Regulatory consequences: a Crypto Governance code?

## Reasons for regulation
- Managing uncertainty
- Complex cryptocurrencies
    - Financial stability -- systemic risk and externality
        - (mandatory)provisions of fincancial market regulation
    - User (or investor) protection -- information and power asymmetries
        - (Soft Law) -- privisions of corporate governance codes.
        
## The governance perspective
- Bringing in spontaneuous and unpredictable interactions
    - Strengthen elements of order and regularity.
- Designation of competencces and procedures
    - Missed what was said here....
    
    
## Advantages of corporate governance
- Implement 'comply or explain'
    - Flexibility and transparency
    - Balancing innovation and user protection
- One set of rules for an international ecosystem
    - solution to puzzels of applicable law, and overlapping regulation.
    
## From corporate to crypto
- Extenal governance (exit)
    - Sale of shares/coins
    - Hard fork/corporate controle
- Internal governance (voice)
    - Directors/miners

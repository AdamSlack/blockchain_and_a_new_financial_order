## Panel 1: THe Law and Technology of blockchain -- An Overview
+ Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems
+ Tomaso Aste (UCL) -- What is truth? Blokchain technology and history by majority consensus
+ Ioannis Lianos (UCL) -- Law, Fintech and the performative turn in regulation
+ Karen Yeung (Kings College London) -- Governence by Blockchain: THe upcoming battle for supremacy between the code of law vs the code as law.
+ Giovanni Sartor (European University Institute) -- Semantics and Pragmatics of self-enforcing laws and contracts

## Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems
+ General Challenges
+ legal and regulatory challenges
+ Technical Challenges
+ business challenges
+ there is overlap between each of these areas

## Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems
+ Multidimensional Challenges
    - Underdeveloped ecosystem
        - Adoption of a blockchain is necessary but not enough
        - need a whole ecosystem of stakeholders focused around the adoption of such a technology
        - Complete Tech stacks.
        - analysts
        - users
  
## Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems
+ Multidimensional Challenges
    - Lack of educated individuals
        - Niche area, means very limited software developers
        - mid 2016 appox. 5000 developers, compare to Java at approx 18.5 million
        - Lack of educated individuals at an executive level.

## Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems
Multidimensional Challenges
- Lack of Standards
    - standards arrive as defacto virtue of market adopetion
    - or via organisations puting standards into place
    - standards will introduce many aspects
        - Increased adoption
        - interoperability
        - lower costs and less overall risks
    - standards also help with other topics
        - use cases
        - terminology, taxonomy, ontology and reference architecture.
            

## Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems
Multidimensional Challenges            
- Blockchain as a foundational technology means it will take a long time for wide spread adoption
- it will rely on a 'kiler app' and such like technology to really push the technology
    

## Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems
Legal and REgulatory Challenges
- Uncertain regulatory status
    - paradigm shifts
    - Regulation yes -- better later than never
    - what can be done to reduce regulatory unsertainty?
    - The uncertainty is normal, its a new technology.
    
- Political/governmental intervention
    - political vision of rhthe current 4IR (what is 4IR???)
    - Internet of value -- dont want to reduce the value that such technology can have
    - Consumer Protection
    - lacking a clear understanding that this is the next industrial revolution.
    - many new challenges from a consumer perspective.
    

## Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems
Business Challenges
- Survey rsults
  - Most difficult and most important - Legal challenges
  - second most difficult and least important - technical challenges
  - least difficult and second most important - business challenges.
  
  

# Tomaso Aste (UCL): What is truth? Blockchain Technology and history by majority consensus
## Tomaso Aste: What is truth? Blockchain Technology and history by majority consensus
Blockchain -- The Trust Machine
- True to some extent
    - verified by large communities
    - hard to tamper with purely cause of size and decentralised nature
    - verified recorded immutable history of fair-play, gives reputation to involved agents.
    
- no need for trusted intermediaries

## Blochchain
 - Google 'structre of blockchain', cba to type it out.
 
## origins of blockchain
- started with Hash trees (merkle trees) and hash chains
- got to electronic hash chain payments in the 90s
- proof of work via Hash Cash
- bitcoin came around after (2008)


## Distribution + Community Consensus = Trues
- Consensus => transparency
- Consensus => Truth decided by community majority
- Consensus => History is probabilistic

All Truth within the system is by consensus
- Not necessarily the Truth, just the aggreed one.
- THe consensus can very well be wrong.
- Generating Hashes doesn't necessarily validate truth.
    - just that is accepted as having happend
    - THen its completely immutable
    - for storing information, this means that lies can be immutably stored.
    
## Consensus comes with a cost
- a lot of people have a lot of insentive to alter the truth
- means that it costs the community a lot of computing power to ensure validity is maintained
- (note: this only applies to proof of work, proof of stake would make it a monetary issue)


## Challenges
-  Efficiency and scalability
- legal implications for code misbehaviour
    - some code may even be automatically generated wihin a distributed and unsupervised system
    - who is responsible
    - who will regulate/supervise
    
- can we afford to keep immutable historic records
    - probably not
    - what if there is a war
    - what if there are criminal organisations?

- can blockchains be made future proof
    - preserve integrity even though in the future current cryptographic technology will likely be broken
    
    
# Ioannis Lianos (UCL) -- Law, Fintech and the perfomative turn in regulation
## Drastic and Disruptive innovation
- bitcoin -- one of the first successful applicaitons of a distrubuted ledger 
- bitcoin 2.0 -- to store all kinds of information
- ethereum -- software platform for the development and deployment of all kinds of decentalised applications

## blockchain and fintech
- 5 principals underlying the technology
    - distributed database
    - p2p transmission
    - transparency with pseudonymity
    - immutability of records
    - comutational logic
    
- fintech is the amalgomation of finance and technology.

# Regulators -- promoting competition and innovation

- financial conduct authority - promote effective competition in the interest of consumers
- payment systems regulator - specific interests relating to the payment sector. promote insterests of users and services provided by payment systems.

# Regulatory Initiatives
- FCA -- project Innovate
- Regulatory Sandbox -- A sandbox from which businesses have a 'safe space' to experiement with new technology.
    - this can be used to introduce unauthorised businesses to the market
    - allows regulatory authorities to test the impact of new regulations.
- Regulation becomes a collaboration industry
    - bespoke regulatory rules
  
# Payment system regulators
- heavily interested in blockchain technology
- Bank of England -- regulatory investigations
    - Research Hub
    - FinTech Accelerator
- Prudential Regulatoryt Authority


# Rules vs prinicals base
- Principals based regulation promotes collaboration
    - authorities state what they want to achieve
    - leades to Algorithmic Regulation
    - Lean regulation
    - Agile regulation
    
    
# Platforms vs Blockchain
- Blockchain aren't platforms
- OpenBazaar, Amazon, Google
- Competition between existing platforms to produce their own system.

# OpenBazaar and markets
Will it lead to a wide open competative market?

- still an issue with centralised groups of hashing teams
- these groups will be competative
    - still not down to the individuals

# Lack of quantitiative measurements for innovation
- As regulatory authories lack methods of quantifying the promotion of innovaiton
    - regarding its success at least
    
- performative regulation will take be more prominent
    - this measn more interaction and involvment between regulators and businesses.


# Governence by blockchain: the coming battle for supremacy between code of law vs code as law.

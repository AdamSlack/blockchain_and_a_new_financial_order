## Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- *Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems*
+ General Challenges
+ legal and regulatory challenges
+ Technical Challenges
+ business challenges
+ there is overlap between each of these areas

## Paolo Tasca (UCL) -- Technical and Legal business challenges of Blockchain Enabled Systems
+ Multidimensional Challenges
    - Underdeveloped ecosystem
        - Adoption of a blockchain is necessary but not enough
        - need a whole ecosystem of stakeholders focused around the adoption of such a technology
        - Complete Tech stacks.
        - analysts
        - users
  
## Multidimensional Challenges
- Lack of educated individuals
    - Niche area, means very limited software developers
    - mid 2016 appox. 5000 developers, compare to Java at approx 18.5 million
    - Lack of educated individuals at an executive level.


## Multidimensional Challenges
- Lack of Standards
    - standards arrive as defacto virtue of market adopetion
    - or via organisations puting standards into place
    - standards will introduce many aspects
        - Increased adoption
        - interoperability
        - lower costs and less overall risks
    - standards also help with other topics
        - use cases
        - terminology, taxonomy, ontology and reference architecture.
            

## Multidimensional Challenges            
- Blockchain as a foundational technology means it will take a long time for wide spread adoption
- it will rely on a 'kiler app' and such like technology to really push the technology
    

## Legal and Regulatory Challenges
- Uncertain regulatory status
    - paradigm shifts
    - Regulation yes -- better later than never
    - what can be done to reduce regulatory unsertainty?
    - The uncertainty is normal, its a new technology.
    
- Political/governmental intervention
    - political vision of rhthe current 4IR (what is 4IR???)
    - Internet of value -- dont want to reduce the value that such technology can have
    - Consumer Protection
    - lacking a clear understanding that this is the next industrial revolution.
    - many new challenges from a consumer perspective.
    

## Business Challenges
- Survey rsults
  - Most difficult and most important - Legal challenges
  - second most difficult and least important - technical challenges
  - least difficult and second most important - business challenges.
  
# Tomaso Aste (UCL): What is truth? Blockchain Technology and history by majority consensus

## Tomaso Aste: What is truth? Blockchain Technology and history by majority consensus
Blockchain -- The Trust Machine
- True to some extent
    - verified by large communities
    - hard to tamper with purely cause of size and decentralised nature
    - verified recorded immutable history of fair-play, gives reputation to involved agents.
    
- no need for trusted intermediaries

## Blochchain
 - Google 'structre of blockchain', cba to type it out.
 
## origins of blockchain
- started with Hash trees (merkle trees) and hash chains
- got to electronic hash chain payments in the 90s
- proof of work via Hash Cash
- bitcoin came around after (2008)


## Distribution + Community Consensus = Trues
- Consensus => transparency
- Consensus => Truth decided by community majority
- Consensus => History is probabilistic

All Truth within the system is by consensus
- Not necessarily the Truth, just the aggreed one.
- THe consensus can very well be wrong.
- Generating Hashes doesn't necessarily validate truth.
    - just that is accepted as having happend
    - THen its completely immutable
    - for storing information, this means that lies can be immutably stored.
    
## Consensus comes with a cost
- a lot of people have a lot of insentive to alter the truth
- means that it costs the community a lot of computing power to ensure validity is maintained
- (note: this only applies to proof of work, proof of stake would make it a monetary issue)


## Challenges
-  Efficiency and scalability
- legal implications for code misbehaviour
    - some code may even be automatically generated wihin a distributed and unsupervised system
    - who is responsible
    - who will regulate/supervise
    
- can we afford to keep immutable historic records
    - probably not
    - what if there is a war
    - what if there are criminal organisations?

- can blockchains be made future proof
    - preserve integrity even though in the future current cryptographic technology will likely be broken
    
    
# Ioannis Lianos (UCL) -- Law, Fintech and the perfomative turn in regulation
## Drastic and Disruptive innovation
- bitcoin -- one of the first successful applicaitons of a distrubuted ledger 
- bitcoin 2.0 -- to store all kinds of information
- ethereum -- software platform for the development and deployment of all kinds of decentalised applications

## blockchain and fintech
- 5 principals underlying the technology
    - distributed database
    - p2p transmission
    - transparency with pseudonymity
    - immutability of records
    - comutational logic
    
- fintech is the amalgomation of finance and technology.

## Regulators -- promoting competition and innovation

- financial conduct authority - promote effective competition in the interest of consumers
- payment systems regulator - specific interests relating to the payment sector. promote insterests of users and services provided by payment systems.

## Regulatory Initiatives
- FCA -- project Innovate
- Regulatory Sandbox -- A sandbox from which businesses have a 'safe space' to experiement with new technology.
    - this can be used to introduce unauthorised businesses to the market
    - allows regulatory authorities to test the impact of new regulations.
- Regulation becomes a collaboration industry
    - bespoke regulatory rules
  
## Payment system regulators
- heavily interested in blockchain technology
- Bank of England -- regulatory investigations
    - Research Hub
    - FinTech Accelerator
- Prudential Regulatoryt Authority


## Rules vs prinicals base
- Principals based regulation promotes collaboration
    - authorities state what they want to achieve
    - leades to Algorithmic Regulation
    - Lean regulation
    - Agile regulation
    
    
## Platforms vs Blockchain
- Blockchain aren't platforms
- OpenBazaar, Amazon, Google
- Competition between existing platforms to produce their own system.

## OpenBazaar and markets
Will it lead to a wide open competative market?

- still an issue with centralised groups of hashing teams
- these groups will be competative
    - still not down to the individuals

## Lack of quantitiative measurements for innovation
- As regulatory authories lack methods of quantifying the promotion of innovaiton
    - regarding its success at least
    
- performative regulation will take be more prominent
    - this measn more interaction and involvment between regulators and businesses.


#Karen Yeung -  *Governence by blockchain: the coming battle for supremacy between code of law vs code as law.*
## Introduction

- explore the intersection and interactions of conventional law and internal rules of blockchain systems

- how success will 'governance by blockchain' be at avoding governance by conventional law?

- Algorithmic Governence
    - predictive analytics and automated decision making systems
    - distributed ledger systems.

- focus on developed markets, undevelopeed markets might not even have a government capable of rivaling 'Cryptolaw'.


## Emergence of CryptoLaw
- Ethereum -- a Cryptolaw system (ie blockchain code as law)
    - a set of rules administered through the use of smart contracts
    
    
## Blockchain as beyond the reach of law
- radical libertarian ideological rhetoric associated with Blockchain technology
    - premise of which is the assumption that the distrubted and decentralised network renders it unregulatable
    
- similar claims were made regarding the internet. this proved to be a falacy

- as blockchain applications emerge they will become more detatched from the ideological side of blockchain.

## Types of interaction between blockchain code and law
- Hostile Evation -- use of blockchain to evade the limits of the law
- supportive alignment -- use of blockchain to compliment and suppliment conventional law
- uneasy co-existence -- use of blockchain to avoid the inconvenience and Mutual suspicion.


## hostile evation
- Use of blockchain tech and decentralised tech to avoid the law.
    - cyber crime, extortion, tax avoidance
- legal systems have asserted sovereign authority of law over thse activities.

- virtual currencies should comply with existing money laundering regulations
- Bitcoin exchanges are treated as regulated intermediaries

## practical battle for supremacy
- considerable challenges in applying conventional law enforcment methods against perpetrators

- conventional law may assert authority over code
    - can it actually exercise that authority though?
    
- this creates a practical battle between the law and blockchain tech

- regulatory targets:
    - wallet providers/exchanges
    
## supportive alignment
- instead of using blockchains to avoid the law -- use to compliment the law.

- can be used to streamline and enhance the efficiency of compliance.

- can provide realtime information on thew state of transacitons between users.

- R3's Corda - distributed ledger designed by and for the regulatory industry.

- not a formal 'battle for supremacy' because they are designed to work together

## uneasy co-existence
- use vlockchain to avoid the procedural burdens and transaction costs associated with conventional law

- not trying to subvert the law
    - just not wanting to bother with the hassel of the clunky and slow system of law that exists.
    
- DAO was an example of this.
    - developed with the intention of engaging in venture style investements to give the everyday consumer the opportunity to invest in exciting projects and startups
    
    
## Uneasy co-existence
- if no hardfork happend after the DAO exploit, would the conventional law reached into the 
transaction? 
- would a court have refused to take part?

## Uneasy co-existence
- are blockchain technologies a legitimate or illegitimate attempt to oust conventional law?
- DAOs exist in a regulatory greyzone, that may not offer liability, protection or accountability guarantees.

# Giovanni Sartor -- Semantics and Pragmatics of self enforcing laws and contracts
## Contracts, logic based smart contracts and blockchain systems
- A project to find a new way to write smart contracts
    - an alternative to Ethereums smart contract system
    
- Aim to reduce the differnece between a smart contract language (like solidity) and human language
    - increased accessability
- imperative languages normally used to create smart contracts
- the aim is to move to a more declarative style


## what is a smart contract?
- a program that is used to express an agreement between users
- a program that enacts some kind of transaction or action.

- These contracts can automatically enforce the agreements made.


## what are the problems with these contracts and all contracts?
- can be very difficult to understand unless familiar with the technology
- often 'seasoned' with additional formalities.
- This is a problem when trying to expand the reaches of the technology to the general public
    - trusting of smart contracts will be difficult if there is no understanding.
    
## Defeasable Logic
- a logic represnetation of smart contracts

## advantages of a declarative language
- accessability for lawyers and non-technical individuals
- means that legal authoroties that would normally draft contracts can ensure no illicit activities are being performed.
- the issue of cancelling smart contracts when legally required (like other contracts) still exists.

## Conclusion
- Smart contracts are good
- need to ensure they are legally compliant.
- adopt a declaritive language for clarity between stakeholders.

# Panel 2 -- *Blockchain and the future of money*
# Stefan Eich -- *The politics of Cryptocurrencies in historical perspectives*

##Crypto Currencies
- Driven by technology
- lacking governence
- cut off from the past (and)

## is that the right framing?

## Argument
- the forget political disputes over money in the 70s
    - actively written out of memory by great moderation
    - but resurfaced again with the financial crisis
- in this ligt cryptocurrences asa political attemt to depoliticise money.

## Hayek, the denationalisation of money (1976)

- ending of government monopoly of the issue of money
- decentralisation

## Gunnar Myrdal Oct 1974
- demands for global democratic reforms
- proposed 'welfare state' becomes a 'welfare world'
    - via reformation of monetary systems on a global scale
    
    
## Politics of Disinflation
- after inflation hikes in the 70's/80's
- new polics of disinflation and monetary depoliticization emerged

## The great Moderation 
- revealed that notion of money existing aside from politics was an illusion

## Financial Crisis
- The emergence of bitcoin after the financial crisis was not a coincidence
- the technology had existed for years
- 6 weeks after the collapse of 'lehsman brothers' (corect spelling) bitcoin emerged

## bitcoin as an experiemnt of artificial scarcity
- the finite amount of bitcoin
- as more bitcoins became owned, they became more valuble

## re-politicization
- just as monetary systems have given rise to calls for decentralised monetary systems
- it has also created a call for more politicised systems.

## to summarise
- cryptocurrency is intself a political act
    - a olitical act of depoliticisation
    
- technology itself is politically neutral
    - blockchains are politically agnostic, even if its applications aren't 
  
- the creators of a cryptocurrency is infact an act of lawmaking
    - centralised around their personal political motivations and ideologies.

# Rosa Maria Lastra -- *Pubic Money vs Private Money*

## Fiat Money
- Funcitons of money
    - medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account.
- governence
    - central bank issue, legal tender, legal counterparty
- risks
    - theft, fraud, counter-party, inflation
- consumer appeal
    - good store of value, realtime, reversible
- foreign exchange
    - costly time
- centralised clearing
    - paypal, apple pay, cheques
    
## Bitcoin (didnt want to talk about ethereum as well)
- functions of money
    - medium of exchange, volitile store of value, negligible unit of account
-governance
    - bitcoin protocol, issuing mining rewards
- risks
    - medium, interface, malfunction, password (key) loss


## Monetary Sovereignty
- Traditionally
    - the power to issue and distrubute money
    - monopoly power enjoyed by the state
- new technology
    - digital currencies, digital payment methods
    - signify the changing state of monetary sovereignty
  

## theories of money
- the state theory of money is different to the society theory of money are contrasting
    - a state's theory of money is that they decide what constitutes of money
    - the sociatal theory is that money is determined by what has value.
    
## Public money
- public money is fiat money backed by the state

- central banks issue all notes in circulation
- fiat money, inconvertable into gold or other precious materials.
    - the government declares the paper money to be legal tender for the settlement of debts
    
## private money
- societal money backed by societal accpetance.
    - enhanced by reputation/credibility.
    - currency does not need to be legal tender to exist.
    
## Boom and Busts
- displacement brings opportunity for profit
    - herd behavioutr from investor euphoria
- as investors decide to cash out, others follow this movement, causing busts as extensive as the booms.

## private money and central banking.
- Crypto currencies challenge the status quo of bank monopoly
- curencies npt backed by any central authority have a value completely dependant on peoples 
confidence to use it.
